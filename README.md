# Object-Detection-and-Image-Segmentation-for-Autonomous-vehicle
This project effectively built and trained a model that can produce a top-down view of the surrounding area of an ego car by (1) locating and classifying objects on the road from images captured by six cameras on the car and (2) generating the road map lay- out by semantic image segmentation..
