# Object-Detection-and-Image-Segmentation-for-Autonomous-vehicle
This project effectively built and trained a model that can produce a top-down view of the surrounding area of an ego car by (1) locating and classifying objects on the road from images captured by six cameras on the car and (2) generating the road map layout by semantic image segmentation.

1. Please run train.py to generate two model paramter files.
2. The image folder is ../data. Might need to change to actual path. 
3. A pretraining script is provided, but is not used by default.
